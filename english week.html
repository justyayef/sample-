<h1>English Week</h1>
<div class="a">
<p>According to the United Nations (UN), English Language Day is celebrated on April 23rd, “the date traditionally observed as both the birthday and date of death of William Shakespeare. The Day is the result of a 2010 initiative by the Department of Public Information, establishing language days for each of the Organization's six official languages. The purpose of the UN's language days is to celebrate multilingualism and cultural diversity as well as to promote equal use of all six official languages throughout the Organization.”</p>
